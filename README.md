A small Snake game built in Python with Pygame

Hey! I built this little Snake game in Python because I was bored. It works on Linux, and the source code is available if you want to tinker with it. If anyone wants to port it to Windows, feel free! It’s not a AAA game, but it’s a bit of fun and highly customizable. Enjoy!
